# fallingsand
A small SDL-based "falling sand" game written in C++ since i've always loved these and wanted to learn how to make something like this.

This is a huge main.cpp file right now, that will change if I don't abandon this project soon...

(Project is just a proof of concept for now and is unoptimized due to complications with a different game of mine becoming popular and requiring more attention.)
